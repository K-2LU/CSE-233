# The Java Language
--------------

Computer language innovation and development occur for two fundamental reasons:
* To adapt to changing environments and uses
* To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming

### Java's Lineage
------
C -> C++ -> Java

Java derives syntax from C and its OOP features were influenced by C++.

### Creation
-----
Java was concieved by James Goling, Patric Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc in 1991.
First working version was called 'Oak' but was renamed to 'Java' in 1995.       
The original motivation of Java was the need for a platform-independent language.

### Impact on the Internet
---------
#### Java Applets
An _applet_ is a special kind of Java program that is designed to be transmitted over the Internet and automatically executed inside a Java-compatible web browser.
The creation of appelets expanded the universe of objects that could move about freely in cyberspace.
However by JDK11 applet support was removed.
         
		 
#### Security
Java enables us to confine an application to the Java execution environment and prevent it from accessing the other parts of the computer.
Hence it enabled programs to be safely downloaded over the internet.       

#### Portability
Code once, run everywhere

### The Bytecode
--------
__Bytecode__ is a highly optimized set of intructions designed to be executed by the JVM, which is a part of the JRE.
