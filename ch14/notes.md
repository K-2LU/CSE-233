# Generics
----------------
Through the use of generics, it is possible to create classes, interfaces and methods that will work in a type-safe manner with various kinds of data.

### What are Generics?
A class, interface or method that operates on a parameterized type is called _generic_, as in _generic class_ or _generic method_.
In pre-generics code, generalized classes, interfaces, and methods used __Object__ references to operate on various types of objects.
The probles was that they could not do it with type safety.

Generics expanded out ability to reuse code by, 
* Adding type safety,
* Streamlining the process as all casts are automatics and implicit
